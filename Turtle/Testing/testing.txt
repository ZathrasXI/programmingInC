using `gcov` to assess test coverage

```
gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -o parse parse.c
./parse
gcov parse.c
```
The output shows % of lines executed, which we can equate to coverage by the unit
tests because when we executed the compiled file we didn't give it any files,
so the only function that ran was `test()`. To confirm this, if we comment
out `test()` in `main()`, then run all of the gcov commands again, we notice
a significant drop in the % of lines executed. The code is being executed by
`test()`.

Each directory has as a `gcov.sh` script which will run the above commands against
the file in that directory.
