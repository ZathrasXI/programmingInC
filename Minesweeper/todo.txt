TODO: uncomment `#-Werror` from the makefile and use this flag to compile, when I have completed the project
TODO: create a function to check if indexs are within the grid
TODO: error handling? e.g. when char not converted successfully in is_valid_number

check with Neill that testing for `is_valid_number()` is acceptable - 
can't test cases < 0 or > 10 because it won't compile
