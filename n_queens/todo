ask: does our program need to be able to handle non-integer input?
ask: can we have a header file for extension.c
todo: refactor code within that is executed after is_unique()
todo 8q.c within is_safe_space(), change:
    if (queen_coords[queen] != UNUSED && row == queen)
    to
    if (queen_coords[queen] != UNUSED && row == queen_coords[queen])


tests


compile with gcc and clang

check with valgrind (compile without sanitize flags first)

check against house style guide

ensure placing of * in pointer names is consistent, either `int* x` or `int *x`

check I haven't accidentally used EXIT_SUCCESS instead of EXIT_FAILURE, and vice versa
