tests

seperate into 2 files? *.c and *.h?

compile with gcc and clang

check with valgrind (compile without sanitize flags first)

check against house style guide

ensure placing of * in pointer names is consistent, either `int* x` or `int *x`

check I haven't accidentally used EXIT_SUCCESS instead of EXIT_FAILURE, and vice versa
